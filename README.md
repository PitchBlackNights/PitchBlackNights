# Hi, I'm Blake
## Bio
Co-founder of [Project Undefined](https://github.com/project-undefined)<br>
I am a new developer with small projects scattered eveywhere. I can barely keep focus on one thing for a while, but hopefully that will change with [Vansch OS](https://github.com/project-undefined/Vansch-OS).
I'm wanting to major in Cybersecurity, specifically Network and Infrastructure security, along with Intrusion detection and Penetration testing.

## Current Projects
